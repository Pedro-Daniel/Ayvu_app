# Ayvu
The Ayvu Project consists of a set of tools that collect language data through audio recordings and a geographic reference of where the person acquired a particular accent. Available through a mobile application, enabling individuals with no prior technological knowledge to access and use these utilities. In addition, there is an online repository with the utilities themselves. The main goal of this project is to achieve an alpha version of this application. As a matter of fact “Ayvu” means “language” in Tupi Guarani, a language from the indigenous native Brazilians.
